This is an educational web tagging program.

Goals:
* To provide tags over URL links, Books, and other types of resources.
* To provide RSS feeds for new tags, resources and all that jive

Why?
Because in the modern world most of our "memory" is stored elsewhere in the 
network and url taggings are useful ways of referring to our mental maps
over information.

So this application would act as a central database over internet (and offline)
content in order to help forgetful people with their knowledge base.

The idea is also to make this social and semi-interactive in order to provide 
useful statistics over which tags a given user clicking, when he/she has been 
clicking them and how that could be used in order to improve their natural memory 
capacity

You might say that this application

How?
By using a web platform with a dry principle.

Future:
* Adding support for interacting with browser plugins. 
* Adding support for localised instalation package and the ability to synch
 different TaggWA applications hosted on different network nodes.
 That is, you would have the TaggWA application on your computer and you would
 have the ability to synchronize that with another computer (or a dedicated 
 server)
